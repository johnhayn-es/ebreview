David Byrne's bastard children venture east for one of their biggest support slots to-date. Let's hope there's _free parking_.

Just five ~~miles!~~ minutes after their sell-out UK tour, Youth Sector make a rambunctious return to the stage to support Kaizer Chiefs at the Congress Theatre in April. 

For the uninitiated, this wild and wide-eyed Brighton five piece boast one of the best and most-original back catalogues in recent memory - boasting numerous learn-every-word songs that we can't stop singing (at strangers at the gym). 

Yes. There is a passing resemblance to the Talking Heads or Devo, but they are more than a pastiche of your friend from art school's favourite 80s bands. 

Quarrels, their latest release, feels like the album they've been building up to since they formed more than 5 years ago. "The Ball" and "Definitive guide to easy living" are the stand-out big hitters, but (honestly) it's hard to pick favourites as the whole album feels like a can of perfectly-engineered ear worms. For the more familiar, songs like "Free Parking" feel more reminiscent of the group's adloescent era. 

### You have to see them live. 
Even their tightly tailored two-pieces can't hold back the groove. It doesn't matter how much you've had to drink. You'll be up and dancing like the best of 'em. And, if their recent homecoming gig at Komedia in Brighton is anything to go by, the set list will be non-stop bangers. 

You will not be disappointed. Don you widest collar and go and see how it's done. 

Watch "The Ball" live in session for Stabal Sessions.
